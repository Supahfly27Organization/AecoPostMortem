# web

The React + TypeScript + Vite app: the digest, the session view and the Rules Inventory.

**All frontend commands run from here, never from the repository root** (Repo Rule 3, PRD §3.1).
There is no `package.json` at the repository root, and a containment test fails if one appears.
`scripts/build-web.ps1` is the scripted form of the build; it pushes into this directory rather than
passing `--prefix`, for the same reason.

`dotnet test` does not build this project — that would make the .NET suite depend on Node.
`npm test` (`vitest run`) is this project's own test command; nothing on the .NET side calls it.

## Structure

| File | What it holds |
|---|---|
| `src/App.tsx` | the three routes (`/`, `/sessions`, `/rules`), all under `AppShell`. Router-agnostic on purpose — `main.tsx` supplies `BrowserRouter`, tests supply `MemoryRouter` |
| `src/AppShell.tsx` | the nav to all three surfaces (always reachable, S-48 Scenario 1) plus `AppStateBanner`, above whichever route's `<Outlet />` content is showing |
| `src/AppStateBanner.tsx` | S-48 Scenarios 2 and 3: fetches `/api/app-state` and renders its diagnosis, distinctly per state — no-source-found, empty-store, and a fourth state (unreachable API) neither Gherkin scenario names but a real machine can hit |
| `src/api/appState.ts` | the `AppStateReport`/`AppStateKind` shapes and `fetchAppState`, hand-kept in sync with `AecoPostMortem.Api.AppStateReport` (`src/AecoPostMortem.Api/AppStateReport.cs`) — no generated client exists yet |
| `src/api/useAppState.ts` | the fetch-once-on-mount hook `AppStateBanner` reads; loading renders nothing rather than a message that might not apply a moment later |
| `src/routes/ComingSoon.tsx` | the placeholder a route with no real content yet renders — naming its own story and release rather than sharing one generic message |
| `src/routes/SessionPage.tsx`, `RulesInventoryPage.tsx` | one `ComingSoon` each, with that surface's own story/release (S-08, S-22 respectively) — not yet built |
| `src/routes/DigestPage.tsx` | FR-41's real content (S-36 + S-54, issues #44/#45): the masthead's repository selector plus the ranked findings, each an expandable `FindingRow`. Fetches `/api/digest` via `useDigest`; loading renders nothing, a failed fetch renders its own `role="alert"` message, the same shape `AppStateBanner` established |
| `src/api/digest.ts` | the `DigestEnvelope`/`FindingEnvelope`/`SuggestionEnvelope`/`RepositoryScopeEnvelope` shapes and `fetchDigest`, hand-kept in sync with `AecoPostMortem.Api.DigestEnvelope` (`src/AecoPostMortem.Api/DigestEnvelope.cs`) — no generated client exists yet, the same gap `api/appState.ts` documents |
| `src/api/useDigest.ts` | the fetch-once-on-mount hook `DigestPage` reads, mirroring `useAppState`'s loading/error/loaded shape |
| `src/digest/FindingRow.tsx` | one digest row (Scenario 1, issue #45): collapsed by default; expanding it reveals the quoted evidence, `ProvenanceBadge`, `RecurrenceStrip` and `SuggestionBlock` |
| `src/digest/RecurrenceStrip.tsx` | Scenario 2: names every session a finding touched (`Recurrence.occurrences`), not only the count |
| `src/digest/ProvenanceBadge.tsx` | PRD §3.8's three provenance levels, rendered distinguishably |
| `src/digest/SuggestionBlock.tsx` | Scenario 4: renders `SuggestionEnvelope`'s `present`/`absent` states — an explicit "No suggestion is offered." for `absent`, never a blank area |
| `src/digest/RepositorySelector.tsx` | Scenario 3 / PRD Part 8 Q5: shows the selected repository and offers every available one — the seam for a later cross-repository view, not that view itself |

## Non-obvious decisions

### The app-state banner is shown above every route, not only the digest

S-48's Scenarios 2 and 3 say "when the operator opens the app," not "opens the digest" — the
diagnosis is a fact about the store and the source, not about any one surface. `AppShell` renders
`AppStateBanner` once, above the routed `<Outlet />`, so the same message appears regardless of
which of the three routes the operator lands on, and steps aside on its own (renders nothing) once
the state is `Ready`.

### A fourth, unnamed state: the API host is unreachable

Neither Gherkin scenario names "the API is not running," but a real browser pointed at a dead
`serve` process hits exactly that — `useAppState`'s `fetch` rejects rather than resolving to a
diagnosis. `AppStateBanner` renders a distinct `role="alert"` message for it
("Could not reach the local API. Is `aecopostmortem serve` running?"), rather than either folding
it into `EmptyStore` (wrong diagnosis: the store might not be empty at all) or showing nothing
(silent from the operator's side, which is the exact failure PRD §3.1 opens this story to prevent).

### The two Gherkin empty states are still hand-kept in sync between server and client

`web/src/api/appState.ts`'s `AppStateKind` union (`'noSourceFound' | 'emptyStore' | 'ready'`) is
typed by hand against `AecoPostMortem.Api.AppStateReport`'s `AppStateKind` enum — no shared schema
or generated client exists yet. `AecoPostMortem.Api.CLAUDE.md` documents the matching regression
test (`ApiHostTests.The_kind_field_is_serialised_as_camelCase_on_the_wire`) that exists precisely
because this hand-kept contract drifted silently once already (a missing naming policy shipped
`"EmptyStore"` instead of `"emptyStore"`, and neither side's mocked tests caught it).

### `/api/digest` is not served yet — `DigestPage` targets the seam, not a live endpoint

FR-41's real orchestration (assembling `MastheadCounters`, a `CheckRegistry` and every `Finding`
from the live store into one `ProcessDigest`) is later work no story has wired into `ApiHost` yet
(`AecoPostMortem.Api/CLAUDE.md`). `fetchDigest`/`useDigest` target `/api/digest` ahead of that
wiring anyway, the same seam `fetchAppState`/`useAppState` established for `/api/app-state` before
S-48 served it for real — today a real browser sees `DigestPage`'s own "Could not reach the local
API" message; the moment a future story serves the route, this page starts rendering live data with
no frontend change. `DigestPage.test.tsx` and `App.routing.test.tsx` mock `/api/digest`'s response
directly rather than waiting for that wiring.

### The repository selector is a seam, not a working cross-repository switch

PRD Part 8 Q5 decided the digest defaults to one repository, selectable. `RepositorySelector` is a
real, interactive `<select>` — choosing a different `availableRepositories` entry does change what
it displays — but nothing in `DigestPage` re-fetches a cross-repository digest when that happens
(no orchestration for a second repository's digest exists yet either). This is this story's own
edge case, not an oversight: implement the default, keep the selector itself real, leave the
cross-repository view to later work.

## Playbook — adding a route

1. Add the page component under `src/routes/`. A surface with no real content yet renders
   `<ComingSoon surface="…" story="S-NN" release="Release N" />` — do not invent a second
   placeholder shape.
2. Register the route in `App.tsx`, under the shared `AppShell` element so navigation and the
   app-state banner stay present.
3. Add its nav link in `AppShell.tsx` if it is one of the three primary surfaces.
4. Cover it in `App.routing.test.tsx` — the route resolves, and (if still a placeholder) the
   correct story/release text is present.

## Status

Routing (React Router: `App.tsx`, `AppShell.tsx`), the two zero-data states plus the "API
unreachable" state (`AppStateBanner.tsx`, `api/useAppState.ts`, `api/appState.ts`), and all three
surfaces reachable — S-48. `SessionPage.tsx` and `RulesInventoryPage.tsx` remain named `ComingSoon`
placeholders; their own stories (S-08, S-22) build them.

The Process Digest (`routes/DigestPage.tsx`, `api/digest.ts`, `api/useDigest.ts`, `digest/`) has its
real content — S-36 (issue #44) built the masthead/ranking contract, S-54 (issue #45) built row
expansion, the recurrence strip, the repository scope contract and this route's actual UI. No story
has wired `/api/digest` to real derived data yet (see the non-obvious decision above), so today the
route always renders its own loading/error state against a real browser.

Test tooling: `vitest` + `@testing-library/react` + `jsdom`, configured in `vitest.config.ts`
(read instead of `vite.config.ts` when both exist, so the React plugin is duplicated there
rather than shared) and `src/vitest-setup.ts` (jest-dom matchers, and `afterEach(cleanup)` since
`test.globals` is off and testing-library's usual auto-cleanup never registers without it).
`npm test` runs the suite once; `npm run build` still type-checks (`tsc -b`) ahead of `vite build`.
