# AecoPostMortem.Rules

Rule-set extraction and the check-shape catalogue: `<custom_instruction>` extraction, rule-set
versioning, tool-vocabulary and role derivation, operand resolution, the check shapes.

## The invariant

**Nothing here may name a tool, an MCP server or a repository** (FR-34, PRD §3.1). This is the one
requirement the operator called non-negotiable, and it is structural rather than conventional so
that one project's source proves it.

**This project references nothing** — no other project, and no persistence assembly. That is what
turns the invariant from an assertion into a test: a project with no persistence dependency has a
very small surface in which a tool name could hide.
`The_rules_project_references_no_persistence_assembly` in `test/AecoPostMortem.Containment.Tests`
enforces it, so adding a reference here fails the build.

It takes plain inputs — rule statements as text, the discovered tool vocabulary as a list, call
counts as numbers — and returns results. `AecoPostMortem.Findings` does the orchestration, reading
through `AecoPostMortem.Data` and writing findings back.

## Status

Empty. The check-shape catalogue is the first thing that lands here.
